# MSCS532_Assignment4

## Heap Data Structures and Priority Queue: Implementation, Analysis AND Applications
This project focuses on working with heap data structures, specifically Heapsort and priority queues. 

## Files
- 'MSCS532_Assignment4.py' : Python implementation of Heapsort; comparison with Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Graph analysis. 
- 'Assignment 4.pdf' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, comparisons, and applications of heap data structures.
- 'Assignment 4.docx' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, comparisons, and applications of heap data structures. This is same as above, just different format.
-  'priorityqueue.py' : Python implementation of a priority queue using a max-heap.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: https://github.com/prashcodes10/MSCS532_Assignment4
2. Make sure python is already installed in the system. 
3. Run the code using the command: python.\MSCS532_Assignment4.py OR python.\priorityqueue.py

## Summary
This project highlights the effectiveness of heap data structures in sorting and managing priorities.
